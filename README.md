CityBike Official brief - Analysis of citibike data for the period between March 2020 and May 2020 to answer the questions:
1 What is a key demographic of the users who are using citibike?
2 What station is the most popular for a journey? 

## Dashboard Analysis

Data was analysed and 2 phenomena were identified:

PHENOMENA 1: Overall the highest number of trips recorded for the time period analysed in this report were for users who were born in 1962. This is shown by the line graph 'Sum of total trip duration (calculated minutes) by birth year'. The dashboard created presents an analysis of this phenomena taking into consideration trip duration and user type variables. 

Even though the highest number of trips was made by those born in 1962, a greater proportion of total minutes (trip duration) was made by those born after this year. Similarly, the highest number of trips were made by those born in 1962, however a large proportion of trips was made up more of those born after 1962. This is demonstrated by comparison of the shaded sections of the line graphs 'Sum of total trip duration (calculated minutes) by birth year' and 'Number of trip (count of Bike ID) by birth year'.

Subscriber user type generally accumulated the most minutes across birth years except for those born in 1962 and 1990 onwards. The line graph 'Total trip duration by birth year & user type' has orange and blue lines and an associated legend which demonstrates this pattern.

An explanation for these phenomena is that younger people are more likely to be able to be fit enough to ride a bile, however again further analysis will be needed to acertain this - such as looking at distance as a variable.

PHENOMENA 2: The overall accumulated total minutes (trip duration) was highest for Liberty Light Rail station. The bar chart 'Total minutes travelled by start/end station' clearly demonstrates this by its large vertical bar. The colors and associated legend also provides information on end station. The dashboard analysis considers user type and bike ID variables.  

The average trip duration by user type for Liberty Light Rail was greater for customers vs subsribers. This is represented by bar chart 'Average minutes by user type for Liberty Light Rail'. This suggests that subsribers may generally use citibikes for shorter regular vs longer trips use however further statistical analysis with a larger data set would be needed to confirm this.

It was identified that after Liberty Light Rail the next most popular stations to commence a bike trip were Newport Pkwy, Grove St Path, Hamilton Park and Marin Light Rail. This is shown in 'Top 5 stations for starting a journey (number of riders by starting station)' bar chart by descending order.

The Bike ID with the most accumulated average minutes was '42149' and therefore this bike ID may be on the priority list for service. This is shown in 'Total minutes per Bike ID for Liberty Light Rail (station with highest total trip duration)' horizontal bar chart by descending order.


## City official requested map analysis

2 map's were made 'start station map' and 'end station map'.

The color of the marker and legend convey the count of bike ID's (number of trips) for that postcode. A darker red color represents a higher bike count and orange color represents a lower count. Hovering on the markers describes station, longitude, latitide and bike count.

The most popular station to start a journey was in the 07302 postcode area and the least popular was 07305.
The most popular station to end a journey was in the 07302 postcode area and the least popular were postcodes: 10019, 10118, 10003 and 10013.
10032 was the furthest postcode that was travelled to.
